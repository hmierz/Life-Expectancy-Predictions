# Life-Expectancy-Predictions
Explores global life expectancy trends and their relationship to socioeconomic factors through data visualization and exploratory analysis.

## Overview  
This project examines global life expectancy data to identify trends, disparities, and influencing factors across countries and regions. Using Python and data visualization tools, the project highlights how life expectancy has changed over time and how it relates to economic and social indicators.  

## Why This Project Matters  
Life expectancy is a key measure of public health and development. Understanding patterns in life expectancy helps policymakers, researchers, and organizations address health inequities, track progress, and evaluate the impact of interventions. This project also demonstrates skills in data wrangling, visualization, and exploratory data analysis â€” all of which are critical in applied analytics.  

## Features  
- Visualizations of global and regional life expectancy trends.  
- Analysis of factors associated with higher or lower life expectancy.  
- Reproducible Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step explanations.  

## Technologies  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## How to Use  
1. Open `life_expectancy_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the cells in order.  
3. Adjust filters (e.g., region, time period) within the notebook to customize analysis.  

## Output  
The notebook generates line graphs, bar charts, and scatterplots showing changes in life expectancy and relationships with socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita.
